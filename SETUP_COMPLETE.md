- **21st-devmagic**: UI component generation tools
- **exa**: AI-powered semantic search

### 2. Agent System (`.cursor/rules/`)

**Comprehensive Agent Architecture:**

#### Core Orchestration Agents

- **PlanningArchitect**: System planning and task coordination
- **DataLayerAgent (Roo)**: Data access and synchronization specialist
- **TaskTracker**: Progress monitoring and milestone management
- **RuleKeeper**: Quality control and standards enforcement

#### Specialized Workflow Agents

- **DeepResearchAgent**: AI-powered research with citation management
- **TypographyAgent**: Text processing and em dash correction
- **DocBot**: Documentation and knowledge management
- **MCPForge**: MCP server configuration and maintenance
- **OpenAIAgent**: General LLM-powered task execution

### 3. Workflow Coordination System

**Three Primary Workflows:**

1. **Em Dash Replacement**: Automated typography correction
2. **Deep Research**: Comprehensive web research with citations
3. **Integrated Book Production**: End-to-end content processing

### 4. Database Schema

**Comprehensive SQLite Database (`shared_utils/data/wellspring.db`):**

- `research_citations`: Source tracking and citation management
- `typography_sessions`: Processing history and metrics
- `workflow_status`: Real-time workflow monitoring
- `agent_logs`: Agent coordination and performance tracking
- `book_metadata`: Project-level information and status

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Run Initial Setup

```bash
./setup_wellspring.sh
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

```bash
# Create your .env file using the template
cp env_template.txt .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys
```

### 3. Restart Cursor

Restart Cursor to load the new MCP configuration and agent rules.

### 4. Test the System

Try these commands to test different workflows:

- "Test em dash replacement workflow"
- "Execute deep research on [topic]"
- "Show agent system status"

## üîß Agent Communication Protocol

### How Agents Work Together

1. **PlanningArchitect** receives requests and breaks down tasks
2. **DataLayerAgent (Roo)** validates all data operations
3. Specialized agents execute their domain-specific tasks
4. **TaskTracker** monitors progress and reports status
5. **RuleKeeper** ensures quality and compliance

### Error Handling

- `missing-context-error`: When required information is unavailable
- `agent-coordination-error`: For communication failures between agents
- Automatic rollback procedures for failed operations

## üìö Documentation Structure

### Rule Files Created

- `global_rules.mdc`: Core system philosophy and coordination rules
- `agent_roles.mdc`: Detailed agent definitions and responsibilities
- `workflow_coordination.mdc`: Inter-agent communication and workflows
- `setup_guide.mdc`: Comprehensive initialization instructions

### Existing Rules Enhanced

- `research_rules.md`: Guidelines for web research workflows
- `typography_rules.md`: Typography correction standards
- `em_dash_rules.md`: Specific em dash replacement rules

## üéØ Key Features

### Multi-Agent Coordination

- **Distributed Task Processing**: Multiple agents handle specialized tasks
- **Data Consistency**: All data operations go through DataLayerAgent (Roo)
- **Quality Assurance**: RuleKeeper validates all outputs
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status monitoring

### Comprehensive MCP Integration

- **13 MCP Servers** for diverse functionality
- **Secure File Operations** with path restrictions
- **Advanced Web Research** with multiple search engines
- **Database Management** with SQLite integration

### Book Production Workflows

- **Typography Correction**: Automated em dash replacement
- **Research Management**: Citation tracking and source verification
- **Content Processing**: End-to-end text processing pipeline
- **Quality Control**: Multi-stage validation and review

## üîÑ Daily Workflow

### Starting a Session

1. Activate Python virtual environment
2. Verify MCP servers are responsive
3. Check database connectivity
4. Confirm agent rules are loaded

### Executing Tasks

1. **PlanningArchitect** receives task requirements
2. **TaskTracker** logs new workflow session
3. **DataLayerAgent (Roo)** validates data needs
4. Specialized agents execute their tasks
5. Progress monitored through structured reporting

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Best Practices

### Data Security

- File operations restricted to project directory
- API keys managed through environment variables
- Database operations coordinated through single agent
- Clear audit trail for all operations

### Quality Assurance

- All agent outputs validated by RuleKeeper
- Structured error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Backup and versioning for critical data

## üìà Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. ‚úÖ Set up API keys in `.env` file
2. ‚úÖ Test em dash replacement with sample content
3. ‚úÖ Execute deep research workflow on test topic
4. ‚úÖ Validate agent coordination

### Advanced Configuration
