"Excellence is not an act, but a habit." — Aristotle

Chapter Overview  
Construction is where vision meets reality—and where leadership, coordination, and documentation must executed with precision and discipline. In behavioral health real estate projects, the construction phase is especially sensitive due to high regulatory scrutiny, complex operational needs, and the vulnerability of future occupants.  
This chapter provides a framework of field-tested strategies and DBIA-backed best practices for managing behavioral health construction, emphasizing the vital role of the Owner’s Advisor in steering the project to completion.  
Key Areas of Focus:  
(Note: The numbering and order of points 5 & 6 in the original PDF's "Key Areas of Focus" list were swapped in the detail that followed. The detailed section order is used below for logical flow).

* **1\. Managing Construction with Behavioral Health Complexity in Mind** Behavioral health projects require elevated technical rigor. Ligature resistance, infection control, dual inspections, and secure patient/staff zones require early coordination with architects, engineers, and clinical leads. An experienced Owner’s Advisor enforces clinical compatibility and compliance, preventing costly rework.  
* **2\. Weekly Field Coordination and Look-Ahead Scheduling** DBIA research shows projects with structured look-ahead meetings are 45% more likely to meet milestones. Trade coordination, sequencing, inspection preparation, and recovery planning must organized weekly and tracked by the Owner’s Advisor.  
* **3\. RFI and Submittal Processes Optimized for Rapid Delivery** RFIs and submittals should follow a tiered escalation model, ensuring critical path issues are resolved within 48 hours. Real-time dashboards and a milestone crosswalk reduce procurement delays and licensing bottlenecks. A clear chain of accountability prevents miscommunication and costly hold-ups.  
* **4\. Managing Quality, Safety, Inspections, and Milestone Tracking** Quality assurance, ICRA adherence, and milestone walkthroughs must planned with precision. Weekly toolbox talks, punchlists, and readiness checklists ensure work aligns with licensing expectations. Owner’s Advisors verify readiness for each inspection, log issues, and close gaps.  
* **5\. Coordinating with HCAI Inspector of Record (IOR) and Licensing Agencies** The IOR is the onsite regulatory gatekeeper. Early relationship-building, transparent updates, and shared readiness walkthroughs reduce inspection friction. Owner’s Advisors serve as translators, aligning field performance with agency expectations, minimizing surprises, and streamlining approval.  
* **6\. Documenting Progress and Avoiding Litigation Traps** Strong documentation isn’t just insurance; it’s a foundation of accountability. Digital logs, field reports, issue trackers, and photographic records serve as compliance evidence and risk mitigation. Biweekly documentation audits by the Owner’s Advisor ensure alignment across agencies.

1\. Managing Construction with Behavioral Health Complexity in Mind  
Behavioral health construction is not conventional construction. It must address:

* Ligature-resistant hardware and tamper-proof components  
* Seismic anchoring for safety-rated furniture  
* Class III/IV infection control zones (ICRA compliance)  
* Secure observation corridors and staff retreat zones  
* Dual agency inspections (e.g., fire \+ licensing)

Best Practice: Utilize a Behavioral Health Construction Compliance Checklist maintained by the Owner’s Advisor to validate readiness at each milestone.  
Case Example: On a 54-bed inpatient project in Sacramento, the Owner’s Advisor identified early inconsistencies in ligature-resistant products and halted procurement, preventing $180,000 in costly retrofits.  
2\. Weekly Field Coordination and Look-Ahead Scheduling  
"The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities." \- Stephen Covey  
DBIA research (2022) confirms that projects with weekly field coordination meetings are 45% more likely to meet milestone deadlines.

**3-Week Look-Ahead Planning Table**

| Week | Lead Role | Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Superintendent | Site logistics, staging, major trades |
| 2 | Project Manager | Punchlist prep, inspection alignment |
| 3 | QA/QC Foreman | RFI clearance, long-lead item review |

**Pull Planning Tips:**

* Use sticky-note scheduling with color-coded constraints  
* Assign leads and dates to resolve blockers  
* Align trades on site access, inspections. Sequence

**Owner’s Advisor Role:**

* Monitor schedule adherence and flag risks early  
* Provide recovery recommendations for critical path delays

3\. RFI and Submittal Processes Optimized for Rapid Delivery  
DBIA Benchmarking (2023) shows that clear RFI/Submittal processes reduce change orders by 50%.  
Submittal Workflow: Submittal → Design Review (3–5 Days) → Return to GC → Procurement → Installation  
RFI Prioritization:

* Tier 1: Critical Path → 48-hour turnaround  
* Tier 2: Design Clarification → 3–5 days  
* Tier 3: Documentation Only → 7–10 days

**Owner’s Advisor Tools:**

* Submittal log with live status  
* RFI dashboard with escalation notes  
* Milestone mapping of field dependencies

**4\. Managing Quality, Safety, Inspections, and Milestone Tracking**

**Field Safety Protocol:**

| Focus Area | Frequency | Lead Role | Reporting Tool |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Toolbox Talks | Daily | GC Site Super | Field Safety Log |
| Safety Audit | Weekly | GC \+ Owner Rep | Checklist Form |
| ICRA Protocols | Daily | ICRA Monitor | Entry Logs |

**QA/QC Workflow:** Substrate Inspection → Rough-In QA → First-in-Place Review → Inspector Sign-Off → Punchlist Turnover

**Sample Inspection Calendar:**

| Date | Type | Inspector | Area | Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| May 2 | Fire Rough | FM | East Wing | Scheduled |
| May 4 | Med Gas Cert | State | Central Core | In Review |
| May 7 | ADA Ramp Final | Local | Entry Vestibule | Complete |

5\. Coordinating with HCAI Inspector of Record (IOR)  
The IOR is the eyes and ears of HCAI on-site. Their role is critical for permit compliance, safety, and schedule progression.  
**Best Practices:**

* Host a preconstruction kickoff with IOR, GC, and Owner’s Advisor  
* Maintain a live log of IOR observations and response actions  
* Invite IOR to all major mock-up reviews and milestone inspections

**Risk Mitigation Tips:**

* Avoid scope surprises; notify IOR of changes immediately  
* Respect authority. Foster proactive partnership  
* Keep submittals, RFIs, and updates transparent and accessible

**Owner’s Advisor Role:**

* Liaison between IOR and clinical leadership  
* Translate regulatory expectations into field implementation  
* Track follow-ups and documentation through closure

**6\. Documenting Progress and Avoiding Litigation Traps**

**Documentation Hierarchy:** Daily Logs → Weekly Photos → Field Reports → Inspection Checklists → Issue Logs → Closeout Records

**Litigation Readiness Tracker:**

| Type | Frequency | Retained By | Platform |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| RFIs/Responses | Daily | CM \+ Architect | Procore |
| Change Directives | As Needed | Owner’s Advisor | Egnyte |
| Inspector Reports | Weekly | CM | SharePoint |

**Owner’s Advisor Best Practices:**

* Require written confirmation for all field direction  
* Use cloud-based systems with real-time version control  
* Perform biweekly audits of documentation and inspection logs

Conclusion: Leadership in the Field  
Behavioral health construction demands precision, empathy, and regulatory fluency. At its core, the construction phase is not just about delivering square footage; it’s about building trust, safety, and long-term healing environments.  
According to DBIA (2023):

* Projects with early Owner’s Advisor involvement are 43% more likely to finish on time and budget  
* Integrated design-construction teams reduce change orders by 50%  
* Strong inspection coordination accelerates licensure readiness by 30%

**Summary Best Practices:**

* Engage the IOR and regulatory agencies early  
* Maintain real-time inspection schedules and punchlists  
* Prioritize compliance with HCAI, ADA. Licensing milestones  
* Use cloud platforms for documentation and progress audits

**Risk Mitigation Essentials:**

* Validate field mock-ups prior to material ordering  
* Track inspector notes and corrective actions  
* Elevate unresolved issues with supporting data and cross-team buy-in  
* Document thoroughly: if it’s not written down, it didn’t happen

Final Thought:  
"The measure of a facility is not only how well it is built, but how wisely it was overseen."

## **As we transition into the final stages of commissioning and operational handoff, the principles discussed herein underscore the indispensable role of field leadership, documentation, and strategic collaboration. What begins as drawings ends as a sanctuary for healing, if done right.**
