In behavioral health real estate development, assembling the right team is the single most important predictor of project success. While strategy and planning establish the vision, it is the human architecture—the roles, relationships, and accountability structures—that turn plans into performance.

Behavioral health projects demand more than routine development expertise. These projects require a team that understands trauma-informed care, healthcare licensure, high-acuity environments, and a public-facing mission. As such, each role must be carefully selected, every relationship purposefully constructed, and the entire structure designed to foster collaboration, trust, and disciplined execution.

In this chapter, we explore the core components of a high-performance project team, from role definition and procurement strategies to the critical leadership distinctions between an Owner's Representative and an Owner's Advisor. We conclude by outlining proven methods to build accountability and collaboration into the DNA of your development team.

**Defining Core Team Roles**

A well-balanced and seasoned project team brings together critical expertise across planning, design, construction, compliance, and financing. Each of the core roles listed below brings unique value and carries distinct risks if poorly selected or misaligned.

**Defining Core Team Roles: Subject Matter Experts Driving Project Success**

A successful behavioral health development project is not built by chance. It receives crafted from a disciplined, expert-driven team led by a clear hierarchy of strategic professionals. In this section, we present the most essential players in the development process, ranked in order of influence and importance. Each member of the team brings unique subject matter expertise that, when aligned under a shared vision, propels the project forward with clarity and precision.

1. The Owner: The Mission-Driven Leader  
   The Owner is the origin of the project's vision and values. They are the financier, decision-maker, and ultimate steward of the project's purpose.  
   Key Responsibilities:  
   * Define the mission, priorities, and success criteria.  
   * Approve all major decisions, budgets, and timelines.  
   * Empower the project team to act on their behalf. An engaged and informed Owner sets the tone for the entire project. Their commitment to quality, community impact, and clinical excellence provides the foundation upon which all other decisions are made.

2. The Real Estate Attorney: The Legal Strategist  
   The Real Estate Attorney safeguards the project from legal, regulatory, and contractual risk. They ensure that every deal is properly structured, every agreement is enforceable. Every step complies with the complex matrix of real estate and healthcare law.  
   Key Responsibilities:  
   * Structure site acquisition, purchase agreements, and land use documents.  
   * Draft and negotiate contracts with design, construction, and consultant teams.  
   * Advise on entitlement, leasing, insurance, and regulatory compliance. This legal expert is a key player from pre-development through closeout, and their counsel helps avoid costly disputes, delays, or vulnerabilities.

3. The Owner's Advisor: The Strategic Integrator  
   Often the unsung hero, the Owner's Advisor is the Owner's eyes, ears, and strategic guide throughout the project. This subject matter expert offers high-level insight into planning, design, funding, construction, and operations. They serve as the connective tissue between team members, protecting the Owner's interests and ensuring mission alignment at every turn.  
   Key Responsibilities:  
   * Guide project delivery strategy (e.g., CMAR, Design-Build, Progressive GMP).  
   * Advise on team selection, procurement. Scope alignment.  
   * Facilitate alignment across schedule, scope, budget, and stakeholder priorities.  
   * Serve as a risk manager and decision-making partner. The Owner's Advisor sees the big picture and the fine print, ensuring long-term sustainability and short-term performance.

4. The Developer: The Financial and Regulatory Navigator  
   The Developer is the operational engine of the project, coordinating feasibility, finance, entitlement, and predevelopment strategy. In many behavioral health projects, the developer is either a mission-aligned investor or a third-party partner specializing in healthcare facilities.  
   Key Responsibilities:  
   * Perform market and financial feasibility analyses.  
   * Secure public and private funding, tax credits. Grants.  
   * Lead entitlements, environmental reviews, and community engagement.  
   * Develop long-term ownership and operating structures. The Developer brings mastery in real estate finance, local policy, and project logistics. Their work is vital to turning a bold idea into a fundable and approvable project.

5. The Architect: The Vision Translator  
   The Architect translates operational goals and clinical values into physical form. This expert leads the design process from programming to construction documents, ensuring spaces are functional, beautiful, and healing.  
   Key Responsibilities:  
   * Conduct stakeholder workshops and design charrettes.  
   * Lead architectural programming and conceptual design.  
   * Coordinate with engineers, consultants. Regulators.  
   * Ensure adherence to behavioral health design standards. An architect experienced in behavioral health brings specialized knowledge in trauma-informed care environments, ligature resistance, and operational safety. Their expertise influences everything from staff workflows to patient recovery.

6. The Civil Engineer: The Site Solutions Expert  
   The Civil Engineer transforms a plot of land into a buildable, service-ready site. They are experts in land grading, drainage, utilities, and transportation integration.  
   Key Responsibilities:  
   * Conduct site surveys and topographic analysis.  
   * Design site access, grading. Stormwater systems.  
   * Coordinate utility infrastructure and "will-serve" letters.  
   * Support zoning, entitlement, and public works permitting. In behavioral health, civil engineers must account for privacy buffers, therapeutic landscapes, and secure site access. Their early involvement prevents costly surprises during permitting and construction.

7. The General Contractor (GC): The Execution Specialist  
   The GC brings the building to life. This professional manages labor, materials, subcontractors, inspections, and jobsite safety from groundbreaking to closeout.

   Key Responsibilities:  
   * Prepare and maintain construction schedules.  
   * Develop budgets, cost estimates. GMPs.  
   * Procure subcontractors and materials.  
   * Ensure construction quality, safety, and compliance. GCs with behavioral health experience are attuned to specialized facility requirements, patient safety measures, and high-stakes inspections. Their leadership in the field turns ideas into brick-and-mortar healing spaces.

These seven roles form the leadership structure of every high-performing behavioral health real estate project. When selected with care, aligned with mission, and empowered to collaborate, these subject matter experts ensure that every dollar spent and every decision made serves the goal of lasting impact.

In behavioral health real estate development, assembling the right team is more than a logistical necessity; it is a strategic imperative. Every successful project begins with strong leadership, clear roles, and expert collaboration. At the core of that leadership triad are:

1. The Owner, who sets the mission and funds the vision.  
2. The Real Estate Attorney, who protects legal integrity and ensures contractual clarity.  
3. The Owner's Advisor, who operationalizes strategy, manages complexity, and aligns the entire team toward successful execution.  
4. The Developer, who runs the day-to-day operations of coordination and execution.

The Owner's Advisor is secondary only to the Owner and Real Estate Attorney in project influence. This role functions as the owner's strategic right hand, deeply embedded in every aspect of the project lifecycle. The Advisor ensures the team is purpose-built, aligned with the mission, and equipped to manage risk across all phases.

Let's explore how each of the core team roles fits into this framework, with the Owner's Advisor serving as the integrator between them.

A successful behavioral health project is driven by the strength, synergy, and structure of its core team. These professionals are not just executing tasks; they are shaping environments that will support healing, dignity, and long-term community well-being. Each role carries unique responsibilities and contributes to a cohesive project ecosystem.

Developer  
The developer serves as the project's central leader and visionary, the party ultimately accountable for success.  
Key responsibilities include:

* Identifying and securing the project site  
* Conducting or overseeing feasibility studies  
* Securing capital and managing investor relationships  
* Leading entitlement and permitting strategies  
* Aligning design, construction. Operations with mission-driven goals

In behavioral health development, developers must also understand:

* Medi-Cal and Medi-Cal reimbursement models  
* State and county behavioral health funding (e.g., MHSA in California)  
* Clinical programming and licensure requirements

Developers must balance bold vision with practical execution, building partnerships and systems that sustain outcomes.

Architect  
The architect transforms clinical intent and operational goals into environments of safety, calm, and healing.  
Key responsibilities include:

* Facilitating early design charrettes and stakeholder visioning  
* Producing conceptual, schematic. Construction documents  
* Integrating trauma-informed design and biophilic principles  
* Coordinating engineering consultants  
* Ensuring compliance with ADA, life safety, fire code, and licensing requirements

Architects in behavioral health design must have:

* Prior experience in inpatient and outpatient behavioral care  
* Understanding of ligature resistance, safety zoning, and patient dignity  
* Capacity to lead inclusive, collaborative design processes

Engineer (Civil, Structural, MEP, Low-Voltage)  
Engineers ensure the technical feasibility, safety, and compliance of the facility's physical systems.  
Typical engineering disciplines include:

* **Civil:** Site grading, stormwater drainage, roads. Utility connections  
* **Structural:** Load-bearing systems, seismic design, and lateral stability  
* **MEP:** Mechanical (HVAC), electrical, plumbing, and fire protection systems  
* **Low-Voltage:** Nurse call systems, security systems, IT cabling, and audiovisual systems

Behavioral health introduces additional design sensitivities:

* Infection control via negative-pressure HVAC zones  
* Acoustic dampening to protect patient privacy  
* Redundant power systems for life-safety requirements

General Contractor (GC)  
The GC is the team member who takes the drawings and specifications and makes the project real. They manage labor, procurement, safety, and schedule on-site every day.  
Key responsibilities include:

* Preconstruction pricing and schedule development  
* Bid leveling and subcontractor selection  
* Jobsite safety and regulatory compliance  
* Quality control and constructability feedback  
* Coordination of inspections, commissioning. Closeout

GCs with behavioral health experience bring key competencies:

* Understanding of anti-ligature hardware and finishes  
* Sensitivity to confidentiality, operational security, and patient flow  
* Knowledge of OSHPD, DSA, or AHJ-specific inspection procedures

Owner's Advisor  
The Owner's Advisor is a strategic leader who operates as the developer's most trusted partner. This role is distinct from an Owner's Representative, as it carries a higher level of insight, authority, and integration.  
Key responsibilities include:

* Assembling the project team and guiding procurement  
* Advising on project delivery models (CMAR, GMAX, Design-Build)  
* Leading budget, risk. Schedule strategy sessions  
* Facilitating team alignment with clinical, financial, and operational goals  
* Monitoring performance and resolving high-level conflicts

The Owner's Advisor ensures every decision remains grounded in mission, quality, and long-term operational success. This role is particularly critical in behavioral health, where decisions impact vulnerable populations and regulated systems.

Construction Manager for Owner (CM for Owner)  
This role provides the Owner with technical oversight of the GC and subcontractors from a constructability, cost, and schedule perspective. The CM for Owner acts as a construction-phase translator and watchdog, especially valuable on projects using CMAR or progressive delivery models.  
Key responsibilities include:

* Reviewing contractor schedules and sequencing  
* Evaluating RFIs, submittals. Proposed change orders  
* Verifying cost estimates and GMAX compliance  
* Monitoring construction quality and site safety  
* Liaising between GC and Owner on construction issues

The CM for Owner ensures the project is built to design intent, on budget, and with minimal surprises. In behavioral health, where operational disruptions can be costly and dangerous, this role is invaluable.

Together, these core team roles form the brain, backbone, and muscle of a behavioral health development project. Their synergy, experience, and alignment to mission are what elevate a project from concept to compassionate care environment.

*(The following two standalone points from the original PDF page 53 are noted for potential relocation or better integration in a later formatting pass, as their current placement is abrupt):*

* *Consider relocating: "Design Competitions or Charrettes: Useful for assessing design vision and engagement strategy."*  
* *Consider relocating or integrating: "Successful procurement is a blend of process and intuition. Formal scoring tools should supplemented with team discussions and references."*

**Selection Criteria and Procurement Approaches**

Choosing the right professionals is as important as choosing the right site. In behavioral health development, selection must account for not only technical qualifications, but also values alignment, communication style. Collaborative capacity.

**Core Selection Criteria**

* Experience with behavioral health or healthcare facilities  
* Familiarity with local entitlement and permitting authorities  
* Understanding of relevant codes and safety standards  
* Reputation for cost transparency and risk management  
* Team chemistry and communication practices

**Procurement Models**

* **Request for Qualifications (RFQ):** Used to shortlist firms based on experience and capabilities.  
* **Request for Proposals (RFP):** Includes fee proposals, project approach, and team bios.  
* **Interview and Scoring Matrix:** Structured interviews with weighted evaluation criteria.

**Contracting Strategies: Progressive Rapid Delivery, Design-Build, GMAX**

Selecting a contracting model determines how risk is shared and how collaboration flows. For behavioral health facilities—which require both speed and flexibility—the contracting strategy must enable iterative development without sacrificing accountability.

Progressive Rapid Delivery  
This approach involves overlapping design and construction phases to accelerate timelines.  
Key characteristics:

* Early GC engagement during design  
* Rolling packages released for early construction (site work, foundation)  
* Active value engineering alongside design progression  
* Best for projects with fixed deadlines or funding windows

Design-Build (DB)  
Design and construction services are contracted through a single entity. This model fosters tight integration and single-point responsibility. Characteristics include:

* Accelerated delivery through parallel processes  
* Fewer change orders and disputes  
* Requires highly experienced teams with strong behavioral health expertise

Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMAX)  
GMAX is often used in Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) contracts. It caps the total project cost while allowing transparency.  
Key benefits:

* Owner sees cost breakdown and retains audit rights  
* Incentivizes early collaboration to minimize cost overruns  
* Includes contingencies for scope uncertainty

Each strategy has trade-offs. The Owner's Advisor can help assess which model aligns best with project risk, complexity, and funding structure.

**The Owner's Representative vs. Owner's Advisor Distinction: Importance of Both\!**

These two roles are often confused, but they serve distinct and complementary functions.

**Owner's Representative**

* Day-to-day project administrator  
* Manages RFI and submittal logs  
* Coordinates meeting minutes and task tracking  
* Acts as liaison between Owner and design/construction teams

**Owner's Advisor**

* Strategic partner with executive-level insight  
* Advises on procurement, contracting, risk management  
* Guides team selection and performance evaluation  
* Helps align project with clinical, financial. Operational priorities

While an Owner's Rep focuses on coordination and documentation, the Owner's Advisor ensures that all decisions remain tethered to the project's higher purpose and mission. The most successful projects leverage both roles, with the Advisor setting the strategy and the Representative managing execution.

**Creating Collaborative Team Dynamics and Accountability Models**

A great team is not simply a collection of talented individuals; it is a living system. In behavioral health real estate, team dynamics can mean the difference between a stalled project and a groundbreaking success.

**Foundations of Collaboration**

* **Shared Mission:** Teams that understand the "why" behind the project make better decisions.  
* **Integrated Kick-Offs:** Early meetings that include all disciplines foster alignment.  
* **Clear Communication Protocols:** Defined meeting cadence, escalation pathways. Documentation standards.

**Accountability Structures**

* **Responsibility Matrix (RACI):** Defines who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each task.  
* **Phase Gates:** Checkpoints where deliverables are reviewed and approved before proceeding.  
* **Performance Dashboards:** Visual tools to track milestones, budgets, and risks in real time.

**Conflict Management**

* Pre-established resolution protocols  
* Neutral facilitation for critical path issues  
* Clear documentation of decisions and assumptions

**Culture Building**

* Celebrate milestones, both large and small  
* Recognize individual contributions publicly  
* Promote psychological safety in meetings

High-functioning teams are built, not born. With strong leadership, thoughtful structure, and a mission-first mindset, behavioral health projects can attract and retain top-tier teams committed to making a difference.

By clearly defining roles, selecting partners with intention, and fostering collaborative culture, you lay the groundwork for a behavioral health facility that is not only well-built. Deeply aligned with its mission.

**Closing Thoughts**

Team assembly is not simply an administrative task; it is the act of building your project's nervous system. Every decision, from procurement model to conflict resolution plan, shapes how your project will function under pressure.

# **Team Assembly and Leadership Structure – Key California Statistics (Chapter 3 Support)**

## **1\. Defining Core Team Roles (Developer, Architect, Engineer, GC)**

Chapter 3 emphasizes assembling a **core development team** for behavioral health facilities. The typical project team in California includes a **developer/owner**, a **health care architect**, a **construction manager (often acting as an executive project manager or owner’s rep)**, and a **general contractor** . These four roles form the backbone of project leadership:

* **Core Roles & Composition:** California’s guidance underscores *at least four primary roles* – real estate attorney (often part of developer’s team), architect, construction manager. General contractor – each engaged at specific project phases . *Graphic suggestion:* **Pie chart** illustrating the four core team roles (each as 25% of the “team”) to show an equal-part collaboration essential for project success. *Context:* This visual reinforces Chapter 3’s point that a balanced team with all key experts is needed from the outset (e.g. attorney hired *immediately*, architect by pre-development, etc.). Supporting members (engineers, consultants) also play crucial roles, but these four lead the project .

* **Impact on Outcomes:** Bringing these team members on **early** has a measurable impact on project outcomes. Industry experts note that early engagement of key team members helps *“lock in resources”* and avoid schedule or budget issues . Nevertheless, many projects still struggle – only about **43–47%** of health facility projects finish **on-time and on-budget** , meaning **over half** run late or over cost. *(For example, 47% of hospital projects in a 2025 survey were delivered on/under budget and on/ahead of schedule. 24% were both over-budget and behind schedule .)* **Graphic suggestion:** a **bar chart** comparing the percentage of projects that succeed (on-time, on-budget) versus those with overruns. *Context:* This statistic underscores Chapter 3’s message – a strong, skilled team can improve these odds. A well-assembled team with clear roles is linked to better performance, whereas projects lacking the proper expertise early often face delays and cost overruns.

*Data gap:* Specific California-only data on team composition and performance in behavioral health facility projects is limited. Most statistics are industry-wide; future research could gather California-specific project audits to quantify how having (or missing) each core role affects cost and timeline in state-funded behavioral health builds.

## **2\. Selection Criteria and Procurement Approaches**

Effective **selection and procurement** of the project team is critical. Chapter 3 discusses methods like RFQs (qualifications-based shortlisting), RFPs (detailed proposals), and structured interviews. Recent data highlight the benefits of prioritizing quality and experience over lowest price in California’s healthcare projects:

* **Qualifications-Based Selection Yields Success:** Selecting teams based on **qualifications (RFQ/QBS)** rather than just low bid correlates with better project outcomes. One analysis found that projects using **QBS** had **half the typical cost growth** – about *3% cost increase* versus \~6% nationally . Moreover, nearly **48%** of QBS-procured projects met *all* schedule milestones with no delays, compared to only **32%** of projects using price-centered selection . This is roughly a **50% increase** in on-schedule project delivery with QBS . *Graphic suggestion:* **Bar charts** side-by-side – one comparing **cost growth** (QBS \~3% vs. non-QBS \~6%). One comparing **schedule success rates** (48% vs 32% on-time). *Context:* These stats support Chapter 3’s guidance to use RFQs/RFPs focusing on expertise and past performance. In California, where complex behavioral health facilities are at stake, a best-value approach can mean fewer change orders and timely completion, as the most qualified teams are chosen – not just the cheapest bid.

* **Key Factors in Winning RFPs:** When using an **RFP (Request for Proposals)** process, what selection criteria lead to success? A national construction survey reveals that the **quality of the proposal** itself is most critical: *content accuracy/completeness* was the \#1 factor in winning (30% importance) . Price competitiveness was only one part of the decision (about 21%, tied with the strength of **relationships/track record** at 21%) . In other words, owners (including California agencies) often prioritize demonstrated understanding, relevant experience. Trust in the team over just low fees. *Graphic suggestion:* **Pie chart or stacked bar** showing the weighting of proposal success factors – e.g. content 30%, price 21%, relationships 21%, etc. *Context:* This aligns with Chapter 3’s advice to use detailed evaluation matrices (for RFQs/RFPs and interviews). It highlights that a well-crafted proposal addressing project needs can outweigh a slight cost difference. California behavioral health projects, which often have specialized requirements, benefit when selection criteria include relevant experience, team capability. Approach – ensuring the chosen team is truly the best fit, not merely the lowest bidder .

*Data gap:* California-specific procurement stats (e.g. how many county behavioral health facility projects use best-value RFP vs low-bid) are not well documented publicly. This is an area for future research – analyzing the procurement approaches used in programs like **BHCIP** (Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure Program (Bhcip)) could provide insight into which methods yield the best outcomes in California’s context.

## **3\. Contracting Strategies: Progressive Delivery, Design-Build, GMAX**

Chapter 3 explores **contracting strategies** such as Progressive Design-Build (a “rapid” collaborative delivery), traditional Design-Build versus Design-Bid-Build, and use of Guaranteed Maximum Price (**GMAX**) contracts. Recent statistics illustrate how these strategies can save time and cost. Is especially relevant in California’s push to quickly deliver behavioral health infrastructure:

* **Rise of Progressive Design-Build in CA:** **Progressive Design-Build (PDB)** – where a design-builder is selected based on qualifications and collaborates with the owner through design – has seen *significant growth in California* health projects in recent years . Major hospital systems are turning to PDB to meet challenges like seismic retrofits and urgent capacity needs. This model allows early team integration and iterative pricing, resulting in faster decision-making and better cost control . *Graphic suggestion:* **Flowchart** illustrating the Progressive Design-Build process (showing overlapping design and construction phases with continuous owner input). *Context:* Chapter 3 highlights such collaborative delivery as a way to expedite projects. PDB’s popularity in California signals that owners value the *speed* and *flexibility* it provides – crucial for behavioral health facilities that often have tight timelines to address community needs.

* **Design-Build vs. Traditional Delivery (Cost & Time):** **Design-Build (DB)** contracting has proven to deliver projects considerably *faster* and with *fewer overruns* than traditional Design-Bid-Build. Industry research (212 projects across the U.S.) shows DB projects are completed **at least 100% faster** (i.e. roughly *twice as fast*) than conventional design-bid-build projects . They also tend to have **lower cost growth** – for example, design-bid-build projects experienced about **3.8% higher cost growth** on average compared to design-build, and CM-at-Risk projects about 2.4% higher . Schedule growth (delays) was similarly lower with design-build . *Graphic suggestion:* **Bar graph** comparing delivery speed (e.g. timeline in months) and cost growth (%) for three delivery models – Design-Bid-Build, CM at Risk. Design-Build – highlighting DB as the clear leader (fastest, least growth) . *Context:* These statistics reinforce Chapter 3’s recommendation to consider **Design-Build** for behavioral health facilities. In California, where many projects face deadlines (e.g. state funding timelines or urgent service needs), the ability to deliver facilities \~**twice as quickly** can mean beds and services become available sooner. Likewise, controlling cost growth is vital when working within grant budgets – DB’s collaborative approach (designer and builder working together) inherently reduces expensive change orders and surprises.

* **Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMAX) Contracts:** A **GMAX contract** is a key strategy to manage cost uncertainty. It sets a firm cap on the price, shifting risk of overruns to the contractor (barring scope changes). The Chapter 3 manual suggests that when negotiating with the contractor, *“the proposal should lead to a GMAX (Guaranteed Max Price) contract”* and even advises including a **10% contingency** in the contractor’s bid for safety . *Graphic suggestion:* **Infographic diagram** showing how a GMAX contract works – e.g. an arrow pointing at a capped budget line, with a buffer for contingency. *Context:* Using GMAX in California’s behavioral health projects gives owners greater cost certainty. Is especially important when using public funds or grants. This strategy, as highlighted in Chapter 3, ensures that once construction is underway, the price won’t spiral out of control – any savings may revert to the owner. Any overages beyond the cap are typically the contractor’s responsibility. The practice of adding \~10% contingency to reach GMAX provides a financial cushion, so the project can absorb minor overruns without exceeding the guaranteed cap.

## **4\. Owner’s Representative vs. Owner’s Advisor**

Chapter 3 distinguishes between an **Owner’s Representative** (OR) and an **Owner’s Advisor** (OA), roles that strengthen the owner’s team leadership. Both act on the owner’s behalf to manage the project. An *Owner’s Advisor* often refers to a consultant guiding the owner through delivery methods like design-build (especially if the owner lacks that expertise), whereas an *Owner’s Rep* might be more embedded day-to-day in project management. Key metrics and insights on these roles include:

* **Risk Reduction & Fewer Change Orders:** Engaging an owner’s rep/advisor provides a **dedicated advocate** to oversee design and construction details, which markedly reduces project risks. This proactive involvement helps catch errors and scope gaps early. Industry experts note that **change orders** are a “budget killer,” and a good owner’s rep *“helps prevent unnecessary costs and reduce change orders by making sure everything is done right the first time.”* By coordinating between the architects, engineers, contractors. The facility’s stakeholders, the owner’s rep ensures nothing falls through the cracks. *Graphic suggestion:* **Before-and-after bar chart** illustrating a hypothetical reduction in number or value of change orders with an owner’s rep on the team (e.g., projects without an OR average more change order costs vs. projects with an OR). *Context:* Chapter 3’s guidance implies that owners (like counties or nonprofits building behavioral health centers) should bring in such expertise if they don’t have it in-house. The above insight supports that advice – an owner’s rep or advisor can pay for themselves by averting costly mistakes and schedule slips (which often come from uncoordinated decisions or missed details).

* **Improved Schedule and Outcomes with Owner Involvement:** Projects with an active owner or owner’s representative show better performance in meeting goals. A Project Management Institute study found that **62% of successfully completed projects had supportive executive sponsors** (i.e. the owner or their representative was actively engaged) . This underscores how crucial an involved owner-side leader is – in fact, *stakeholder/sponsor engagement* was rated the single most important factor for project success in that research . Conversely, lack of clear direction from the owner is often cited in project failures. *Graphic suggestion:* **Bar graph** comparing project success rates with and without active owner sponsorship (e.g., showing \~62% success with engaged sponsor vs significantly lower without). *Context:* Chapter 3’s discussion of Owner’s Rep/Advisor roles ties directly to this data – it’s about ensuring the owner’s interests are continuously represented. In California’s behavioral health projects, an owner’s advisor might guide a county through a progressive design-build for a new clinic, or an owner’s rep might manage day-to-day construction of a non-profit’s treatment facility. Both roles drive accountability. By keeping the owner’s requirements front-and-center and decisions prompt, they boost the chance that the project will delivered as intended (on time, on budget. Aligned with program needs).

*Data gap:* Missing: published quantitative studies isolating the impact of Owner’s Reps/Advisors in California **behavioral health facility** projects specifically. Most evidence is anecdotal or cross-industry. To bolster future Chapter 3 guidance, California could track metrics (like % schedule delay or % budget change) on state-funded projects with vs. without dedicated owner’s rep services – this would statistically confirm the value these roles add in keeping projects on track.

## **5\. Collaborative Team Dynamics and Accountability Models**

Finally, Chapter 3 highlights **collaborative team dynamics** (e.g. partnering, communication) and **accountability models** (like RACI charts – Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed – and phase-gate approvals). These tools and cultural practices improve efficiency. Recent data strongly support the idea that high collaboration and clear accountability yield better project outcomes:

* **Collaboration Improves Efficiency:** Traditional siloed project delivery often leads to inefficiencies – an estimated **70% of conventional construction projects end up over budget or behind schedule** . By contrast, fully **collaborative approaches** such as Integrated Project Delivery (**IPD**) combined with Lean methods show **dramatic improvements**. On average, IPD/Lean projects report about **74% finishing ahead of schedule**, **64% with cost savings** (greater profitability), **77% safer work environments**, and **80% higher client satisfaction** . These percentages far exceed what is typical in standard projects. *Graphic suggestion:* A **comparative infographic** (e.g. side-by-side panels) labeled “Traditional vs. Collaborative Projects,” listing the above metrics (schedule, cost, safety, satisfaction) – the collaborative side vastly outperforming. *Context:* This resonates with Chapter 3’s goal of fostering a team environment with shared accountability. In practice, California behavioral health facility projects that have employed more collaborative delivery (for example, using IPD contracts or at least early contractor involvement and teamwork exercises) could expect fewer delays and budget issues. The data shows that when teams work in an integrated fashion (shared goals, real-time problem solving), they can avoid the common pitfalls that plague less coordinated projects.

* **Clear Accountability & Defined Roles:** Using formal **responsibility assignment tools** (like RACI matrices) and stage gate reviews ensures everyone knows who is doing what and when. Lack of role clarity or goal clarity is a major factor in project failures – in fact, **37% of project failures** in one survey were attributed to not having clear goals (which often links to unclear responsibilities) . On the flip side, organizations with mature project governance (defined roles, rigorous planning) have much higher success rates – they meet original project goals **89% of the time vs. only 34%** in low-maturity organizations . That means projects are about **2.5 times more successful** when proper project management practices are in place. Includes clear accountability assignments. *Graphic suggestion:* **Clustered bars** showing success vs failure rates in organizations with weak vs strong project role clarity (illustrating 34% vs 89% success, for example). Alternatively, a **RACI diagram graphic** highlighting how tasks are assigned could accompany a stat call-out that “Projects with well-defined team roles are far likelier to succeed.” *Context:* Chapter 3’s advice to establish tools like a RACI chart and to implement phase gate approvals for key project stages receives validated from these figures. By clearly delineating who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each task, the team avoids confusion and duplication of work. In California’s public capital projects, this kind of rigor (often mandated by agencies) has been shown to reduce delays. Although specific data for behavioral health facilities is pending, the general principle holds: a **culture of accountability** and clarity – where each team member understands their duties – correlates with delivering the project to scope, on time. On budget.

*Note:* While quantitative data specific to California behavioral health projects is limited in some of these areas, the overarching trends are clear. Future California-focused studies (for example, tracking the outcomes of the new state-funded projects under the 2025 bond) could provide more tailored insights. Nonetheless, the statistics above (many from 2024\) reinforce Chapter 3’s core message: **Assemble a qualified, collaborative team. Use disciplined selection and contracting methods; and establish clear leadership and accountability.** These practices, supported by data, greatly increase the chances of project success when building behavioral health facilities in California.
