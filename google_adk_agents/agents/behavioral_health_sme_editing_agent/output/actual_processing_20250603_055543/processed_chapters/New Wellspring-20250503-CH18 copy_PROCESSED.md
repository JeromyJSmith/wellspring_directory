Chapter Overview  
Commissioning, closeout, and activation represent the culmination of a behavioral health facility’s development journey. This is the phase where construction transitions into care, and where systems, operations, and people must align in readiness. The goal is not simply occupancy; it is operational excellence from day one.  
This chapter outlines the critical steps, best practices, and field-tested strategies to commission systems, prepare staff, and optimize facility performance. These activities are essential to ensure the building not only opens, but thrives in service to its mission.  
"Quality means doing it right when no one is looking." — Henry Ford  
"A building is not complete until it performs its purpose for healing, safety. Enduring care."  
Commissioning and activation are not the end of the project; they are the beginning of its life. For behavioral health facilities, this phase ensures that buildings not only open but operate seamlessly, safely, and in alignment with the clinical mission. It is a time of testing, training, fine-tuning, and transferring knowledge. Done well, this phase turns handover into healing.

Research from the AIA and DBIA (2022) shows that behavioral health projects with structured commissioning protocols and stakeholder-informed activation plans are 38% more likely to meet operational performance goals within the first 90 days. Furthermore, facilities that conduct post-occupancy evaluations report 25% fewer maintenance issues in year one and a 20% increase in patient and staff satisfaction.

"You don’t close the project. You launch the operation." — Project Management Proverb

Once the building is occupied, active management of warranties, service calls, and early performance tuning becomes essential to long-term success. This chapter outlines best practices across five critical domains of project closeout.

1\. Facility Commissioning for Life Safety and Behavioral Health-Specific Systems  
Facility commissioning (Cx) ensures that all critical systems perform as designed, especially in environments where life safety and behavioral health-specific needs intersect. This includes ligature-resistant fixtures, negative-pressure rooms, security systems, HVAC zoning. Emergency backup power.  
**Best Practices Include:**

* Engage a certified, third-party commissioning agent (CxA) during the design development phase.  
* Develop a Behavioral Health-Specific Commissioning Plan covering ligature resistance, airflow control, visual monitoring systems, egress safety, and access control.  
* Coordinate system validations and testing with Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJs), including the Fire Marshal, local Building Inspector, HCAI (formerly OSHPD), and DHCS surveyors.  
* Include startup and performance testing for essential systems like smoke evacuation, access-controlled doors, backup generators, and nurse call stations.

**Construction Manager Role:**

* Align commissioning scope with state and federal licensing requirements.  
* Integrate commissioning milestones into the master project schedule.  
* Facilitate interdisciplinary commissioning meetings, ensure proper documentation, and lead resolution of deficiencies identified during functional testing.  
* Maintain a commissioning log with issue tracking, assignment of responsibilities, and resolution verification.

**Results and Research:**

* Projects that implement commissioning planning during schematic design are 47% more likely to pass their first life safety inspection without correction notices (DBIA, 2022).  
* Commissioned behavioral health facilities see 22% fewer equipment failures in the first year of operation (National Institute of Building Sciences, 2021).  
* Facilities with behavioral health-specific commissioning protocols report a 15–20% reduction in patient complaints related to comfort and safety (CHD, 2021).

Commissioning is not just a technical exercise; it’s a strategic process that ensures clinical performance, safety compliance, and patient-centered operational integrity. Through early planning, team coordination, and rigorous testing, commissioning helps facilities fulfill their promise to those they serve.

2\. Transition-to-Operations Planning and Staff Readiness  
Operational readiness is as critical as physical completion. It bridges the gap between a completed building and a functioning care environment. This includes orienting staff, testing systems under real-life conditions. Validating workflows.  
**Best Practices Include:**

* Create a Transition-to-Operations (T2O) Plan that aligns with the commissioning schedule, move-in date, and staffing plans.  
* Conduct “Day-in-the-Life” simulation training to test clinical workflows, response protocols, and space utilization.  
* Develop a Readiness Matrix tying operational responsibilities to specific milestones for IT, clinical, custodial, and administrative teams.  
* Incorporate role-based checklists for each department, ensuring nothing is overlooked during the handoff phase.

**Common Challenges & Solutions:**

* **Incomplete clinical training:** Schedule hands-on orientation and simulation sessions 4–6 weeks before go-live.  
* **Departmental miscommunication:** Hold weekly transition syncs, bringing together leads from operations, facilities, IT, and leadership.  
* **Missed system dependencies:** Build crosswalk trackers that link construction closeout, FF\&E delivery, IT activation, and staff onboarding.

**Results and Research:**

* Facilities with structured T2O protocols report a 32% improvement in staff onboarding satisfaction and a 22% reduction in startup-related errors (AIA Healthcare Design Insights, 2021).  
* Transition planning that includes simulation-based testing leads to 18% fewer patient safety events during the first 90 days (Joint Commission, 2022).  
* Organizations that embed cross-functional T2O planning into the project schedule report a 28% faster ramp-up to full operational capacity (Health Facilities Management Journal, 2022).

3\. O\&M Manuals, Training, and Facility Performance  
Operations and Maintenance (O\&M) documentation is the bedrock of long-term facility health. Comprehensive manuals and staff training ensure smooth, safe operation and reduce reliance on third-party vendors for maintenance.  
**Best Practices Include:**

* Require all O\&M materials to be provided in both print and searchable digital formats.  
* Host system-specific training sessions led by equipment vendors or subcontractors for HVAC, electrical, fire/life safety. Building management systems.  
* Develop a full asset inventory and preventive maintenance schedule that aligns with manufacturer specifications and warranty requirements.  
* Incorporate building analytics and digital dashboards to monitor system performance.

**Construction Manager Role:**

* Verify completeness and format of all documentation.  
* Coordinate and record all training sessions for future reference.  
* Facilitate structured handoff meetings between the general contractor, system vendors, and the facility maintenance (FM) team.

**Results and Research:**

* Properly trained FM teams reduce unplanned maintenance costs by 27% in the first year (National Institute of Building Sciences, 2022).  
* Hospitals and behavioral health facilities that invest in digital O\&M systems report 30% faster response times to facility issues (Health Care Facilities Today, 2021).  
* Well-executed O\&M handoffs lead to a 22% increase in staff confidence during the first year of operation (Center for Health Design, 2022).

4\. Managing Warranties, Facilities Handoff, and 90-Day Tuning  
Warranties are only valuable if actively managed. The first 90 days are the most critical for resolving latent issues, correcting installations. Optimizing performance.  
**Best Practices Include:**

* Use a 90-Day Tuning Plan for HVAC, lighting, and access control systems.  
* Establish a Warranty Log with action owners and resolution timelines.  
* Conduct joint Owner-GC-FM walkthroughs at 30, 60, and 90 days.

**Construction Manager Role:**

* Track unresolved punchlist items impacting warranty.  
* Ensure GC remains accountable for incomplete or defective work.  
* Support communication with vendors during post-occupancy fine-tuning.

Statistic: Behavioral health facilities with structured tuning protocols experience a 35% reduction in service calls within the first 6 months (DBIA, 2022).

5\. Lessons Learned and Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE)  
Post-occupancy evaluations transform experience into wisdom. Capturing lessons learned builds institutional knowledge and improves future project outcomes.  
**Best Practices Include:**

* Schedule a POE at 6 and 12 months post-opening.  
* Use surveys and interviews with clinical, administrative. Maintenance staff.  
* Evaluate safety incidents, workflow bottlenecks, energy use, and patient feedback.

**Implementation:**

* Compile findings into a closeout report.  
* Share results with future project teams.  
* Incorporate POE insights into design and planning standards.

Result: Projects that conduct structured POEs are 31% more likely to make effective updates to operations and reduce unplanned capital repairs in years 2–5 (CHD, 2021).

## **Final Thought: Commissioning With Purpose Commissioning and activation are not just technical milestones; they are moments of mission realization. They define how a facility will serve, protect, and support those who need it most. In behavioral health care, the bar is higher. Systems must function flawlessly, environments must promote recovery, and operations must launch with confidence. The Construction Manager is a pivotal leader in this transition, overseeing closeout activities, enabling the FM team, and ensuring seamless handoff to operations. Projects that follow best practices (like early stakeholder engagement, simulation training, integrated tuning, and structured POEs) experience measurable improvements in safety, satisfaction, and cost efficiency. In the best projects, activation isn’t the end. It’s the first day of fulfilling the mission. Through rigorous commissioning, clear expectations, and a culture of respect, these facilities don’t just open; they begin to heal.**
