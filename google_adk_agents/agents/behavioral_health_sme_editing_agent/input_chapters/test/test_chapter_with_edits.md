# Chapter Test: Framework Implementation

## Strategic Foundation

The first pillar of our behavioral health continuum infrastructure program
establishes comprehensive care delivery systems. This initiative addresses
critical needs through strategic facility development.

## Regulatory Alignment

Projects are being accelerated through collaborative partnerships with the
department of health care services. Our psychiatric health facility will provide
trauma informed care services that meet crisis stabilization unit requirements.

## Implementation Framework

The mental health services act provides regulatory guidance while medicaid
funding supports comprehensive service delivery. All behavioral health urgent
care facilities must demonstrate compliance with established standards.

## Conclusion

These foundational pillars ensure that our pre-application consultation
processes align with BHCIP program requirements for sustainable facility
development.
