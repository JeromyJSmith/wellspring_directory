# Chapter 3: Community Engagement and Stakeholder Collaboration

## Community Partnerships

The foundational pillars of community engagement ensure that behavioral health
initiatives meet local needs. Stakeholder input guides facility planning and
service delivery models.

## Funding and Implementation

Pre-application consultation processes are being facilitated to streamline
project development. The mental health services act provides the regulatory
framework for these collaborative efforts.

## Regional Coordination

Facility development requires coordination across multiple agencies and
community organizations. This comprehensive approach is designed to maximize
impact and ensure sustainable outcomes.

## Quality Assurance

All community-based programs must demonstrate alignment with behavioral health
continuum infrastructure program standards. Regular evaluation ensures
continuous improvement and regulatory compliance.
