## Chapter 1: Behavioral Health Transformation Overview

The first pillar of behavioral health transformation was established through
Proposition 1. In March 2024, California voters passed Proposition 1, which was
a two-bill package that aims to modernize the state's behavioral health care
system. This initiative is designed to improve accountability and increase
transparency. It also seeks to expand the capacity of behavioral health care
facilities for Californians.

The initiative consists of the Behavioral Health Services Act (SB 326) and the
Behavioral Health Infrastructure Bond Act of 2024 (BHIBA) (AB 531). The first
component focuses on reforming behavioral health care funding to provide
services to those with the most serious mental illnesses and treat substance use
disorders. Additionally, it aims to expand the behavioral health workforce to
reflect and connect with California's diverse population.

There is a critical need to focus on outcomes, accountability, and equity. This
comprehensive approach involves funding behavioral health treatment beds,
supportive housing, and community sites. The legislation also directs funding
for housing for veterans with behavioral health needs, which is an important
component of the overall strategy.

## Chapter 2: BHIBA Implementation and DHCS Authority

The BHIBA portion represents a $6.38 billion general obligation bond to develop
an array of behavioral health treatment facilities. These facilities will
include residential care settings and supportive housing to help provide
appropriate care facilities for individuals experiencing mental health and
substance use disorders.

DHCS was authorized to award up to $4.4 billion in BHIBA funds for BHCIP
competitive grants. These grants are intended to expand behavioral health
facility infrastructure. Of these funds, $1.5 billion will be awarded only to
counties, cities, and tribal entities. Additionally, $30 million has been set
aside specifically for tribal entities.

The department released a comprehensive needs assessment on January 10, 2022.
This needs assessment was designed to provide data and stakeholder perspectives
for DHCS as it implements major behavioral health initiatives. The assessment
focuses on expanding the behavioral health infrastructure through BHCIP and is
titled "Assessing the Continuum of Care for Behavioral Health Services in
California."

## Chapter 3: BHCIP Guiding Principles and Priority Framework

The BHCIP program is guided by several key principles that are designed to
address urgent needs in the care continuum. These principles focus on people
with mental health or substance use conditions, including unhoused people,
veterans, older adults, adults with disabilities, and children and youth.

A major priority is to invest in behavioral health and community care options
that advance health equity. This involves increasing options across the life
span that serve as an alternative to incarceration, hospitalization,
homelessness, and institutionalization.

The program seeks to meet the needs of vulnerable populations with the greatest
barriers to access. This includes people experiencing unsheltered homelessness
and justice involvement. It is important to ensure that care can be provided in
the least restrictive settings to support community integration, choice, and
autonomy.

The initiative aims to leverage county and Medi-Cal investments to support
ongoing sustainability. Additionally, it leverages the historic state
investments in housing and homelessness to create a comprehensive approach to
behavioral health care infrastructure development.
