In March 2024, California voters passed Proposition 1, which was a two-bill package that aims to modernize the state's behavioral health care system. This initiative is designed to improve accountability and increase transparency. It also seeks to expand the capacity of behavioral health care facilities for Californians.

The initiative consists of the Behavioral Health Services Act (SB 326) and the Behavioral Health Infrastructure Bond Act of 2024 (BHIBA) (AB 531). The first component focuses on reforming behavioral health care funding to provide services to those with the most serious mental illnesses and treat substance use disorders. Additionally, it aims to expand the behavioral health workforce to reflect and connect with California's diverse population.

There is a critical need to focus on outcomes, accountability, and equity. This comprehensive approach involves funding behavioral health treatment beds, supportive housing, and community sites. The legislation also directs funding for housing for veterans with behavioral health needs, which is an important component of the overall strategy."""

DHCS was authorized to award up to $4.4 billion in BHIBA funds for BHCIP competitive grants. These grants are intended to expand behavioral health facility infrastructure. Of these funds, $1.5 billion will be awarded only to counties, cities, and tribal entities. Additionally, $30 million has been set aside specifically for tribal entities.

The department released a comprehensive needs assessment on January 10, 2022. This needs assessment was designed to provide data and stakeholder perspectives for DHCS as it implements major behavioral health initiatives. The assessment focuses on expanding the behavioral health infrastructure through BHCIP and is titled "Assessing the Continuum of Care for Behavioral Health Services in California." """

These principles focus on people with mental health or substance use conditions, including unhoused people, veterans, older adults, adults with disabilities, and children and youth.

A major priority is to invest in behavioral health and community care options that advance health equity. This involves increasing options across the life span that serve as an alternative to incarceration, hospitalization, homelessness, and institutionalization.

The program seeks to meet the needs of vulnerable populations with the greatest barriers to access. This includes people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and justice involvement. It is important to ensure that care can be provided in the least restrictive settings to support community integration, choice, and autonomy.

The initiative aims to leverage county and Medi-Cal investments to support ongoing sustainability. Additionally, it leverages the historic state investments in housing and homelessness to create a comprehensive approach to behavioral health care infrastructure development."""
