Chapter Purpose
This chapter demystifies the pivotal transition from planning to physical execution.

Procurement and preconstruction are where your project’s vision becomes a quantifiable strategy.

For behavioral health developments—where every dollar matters and every detail impacts vulnerable populations—this stage is not just preparatory; it’s foundational.

Section 1: Value Engineering with Purpose
"Value engineering is not about cutting cost; it’s about maximizing impact with the dollars you have."
Core Principles
Align all cost-reduction efforts with patient-centered mission  .

Maintain performance, safety, and design intent  .

Evaluate long-term facility operation and maintenance impacts.

Structured Value Engineering (VE) Process
Define Scope and Intent: Set VE goals and constraints upfront  .

Host VE Workshops: Involve interdisciplinary stakeholders  .

Use Decision Logs: Document choices and rationale  .

Evaluate Risk: Vet tradeoffs with lifecycle performance metrics.

Practical Applications

Issue a Room-by-Room Matrix with detailed responsibilities  .

Create a trade scope master list with all interdependencies.

Preventative Change Order Protocols
Implement a Pre-GMP Change Order Log  .

Chapter Summary: Procurement as Strategic Execution
Procurement and preconstruction set the tone for construction.

Done well, they eliminate chaos, reduce uncertainty, and enhance team confidence.

Done poorly, they breed conflict, cost overruns, and delays.

This stage isn’t about pushing paper.

It’s about project leadership.

The Owner’s Advisor, working in tandem with designers, contractors, and vendors, becomes the thread that weaves all complexity into clarity.

Leadership Insight: "In real estate, execution is everything.

But before that, it’s alignment." — Anonymous

In the chapters to come, we shift from planning to action, where the quality of your preconstruction preparation will be tested on every beam, wall, and system installed in the field.
