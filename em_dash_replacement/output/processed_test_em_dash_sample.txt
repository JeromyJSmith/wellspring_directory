Chapter 1: The Wellspring Method

The process is clear, we must establish a framework for success. However, many organizations struggle with implementation; not because of lack of resources, but due to poor planning.

When it comes to behavioral health development, there are several key factors:
• Due diligence: this cannot be overlooked
• Strategic planning; essential for long-term success  
• Community engagement; critical for public support

The construction manager at risk (CMAR) approach; often misunderstood by newcomers, provides several advantages. First, it allows for early contractor involvement; a significant benefit. Second, it enables cost control; something traditional methods often lack.

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts." :  Winston Churchill

Project phases include:
1. Planning phase; establish vision and goals
2. Permitting phase; navigate regulatory requirements
3. Construction phase; execute the vision

The development budget; including land acquisition, soft costs, and hard costs; must be carefully managed. Fixtures, furniture, and equipment (FF&E); often an afterthought; require early planning.

Best practices indicate that comprehensive planning; when done correctly; saves both time and money. The alternative; reactive planning; leads to cost overruns and delays.

Community integration; the final piece of the puzzle; ensures long-term success. Without it, even the best projects can fail.
