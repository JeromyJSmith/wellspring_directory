Part 1: Setting The Vision
The Wellspring was written to empower professionals to create
behavioral health facilities that are clinically sound, financially
viable, and deeply responsive to the communities they serve.
It’s a guide for those who are ready to build not just faster—but
smarter, more intentionally, and in ways that truly serve pa-
tients, providers, and the public good.

Introduction
The Wellspring: A Manual of Best Practices
for Strategic Execution & Rapid Delivery of
behavioral Health Facility Development
Welcome to The Wellspring, a definitive guide for shaping the
future of behavioral health infrastructure through intelligent
real estate strategy, design excellence, and project execution.
This manual is more than a set of guidelines—it is a field-test-
ed framework for achieving the vision of world-class behavior-
al health care environments delivered rapidly, affordably, and
with clinical precision.
At a time when mental health needs are escalating across Cali-
fornia and the nation, our systems face a decisive question: can
we build faster, smarter, and more compassionately? This book
responds with a resounding yes—if we follow best practices.
Backed by research from the American Institute of Architects
(AIA), the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA), and
leading institutions in healthcare planning, The Wellspring lays
out over 100 actionable strategies proven to increase project
success rates, reduce change orders by up to 50%, and deliver
better patient and staff outcomes.
Whether you are a healthcare executive, developer, architect,
policy leader, or Owner’s Advisor, this manual provides an
integrated blueprint to guide your work—from early feasibility
to facility activation. Drawing on decades of field experience
and emerging research in trauma-informed design, biophilia,
construction delivery, and stakeholder engagement, The Well-
spring is your companion for creating behavioral health facil-
ities that heal communities, strengthen systems, and elevate
human dignity.

“Without strategy, execution is aimless.
Without execution, strategy is useless.”

What you will learn in this chapter:
• Market Studies and Needs Assessments
• Site Selection Criteria Specific to Behavioral Health
• Zoning, Access to Services, and Neighborhood Integration
• Preliminary Budgeting and Pro Forma Modeling
• Risk Identification and Mitigation Strategies
• Due Diligence Process
• Real Estate Development Process
Strategic planning is the bedrock of successful behavioral
health real estate development. While construction mile-
stones and design innovation often steal the spotlight, it is the
thoughtful, data-informed groundwork laid in the early phases
that determines whether a project thrives, stalls, or fails. In
this chapter, we explore the foundational elements of planning
and feasibility that ensure projects are aligned with real-world
needs, financially viable, and ready to navigate a complex reg-
ulatory and community landscape.

of design, project risk is reduced by 25%, and schedule certain-
ty increases by over 30%.
This level of strategic integration is essential in behavioral
health, where facilities must meet demanding codes, serve vul-
nerable populations, and support long-term operational success.
A missed regulatory requirement or an underestimated cost
variable can derail not just a schedule—but an entire mission.
Final Thoughts: From Planning to Transformation
The chapters ahead will explore how strategic plans evolve into
design documents, bid packages, construction milestones, and
clinical operations. But as this chapter affirms, those outcomes
are only as strong as their foundation.
Success is cultivated, not assumed. It begins with a disciplined
Owner’s Advisor, a team of engaged professionals, a process
rooted in real data, and a shared commitment to purpose.

In behavioral health real estate development, assembling the right
team is the single most important predictor of project success. While
strategy and planning establish the vision, it is the human architec-
ture—the roles, relationships, and accountability structures—that
turn plans into performance.
Behavioral health projects demand more than routine development
expertise. These projects require a team that understands trauma-in-
formed care, healthcare licensure, high-acuity environments, and a
public-facing mission. As such, each role must be carefully selected,
every relationship purposefully constructed, and the entire structure
designed to foster collaboration, trust, and disciplined execution.

is a site not just selected, but strategically secured.
Final Thought
“95% of a project’s success is determined before the first
brick is laid.” — DBIA Core Principles
That statement is truer in behavioral health than almost any
other sector. The facility we dream of tomorrow—safe, dig-
nified, healing, sustainable—must be born from the discipline
and expertise we invest today.
With intelligent site selection, comprehensive due diligence,
and an empowered Owner’s Advisor at the helm, we don’t
just pick a property—we build a legacy of care.

Stakeholder engagement done right mitigates project risk,
secures entitlements faster, builds goodwill with local agencies,
and increases facility success metrics across the board. It also
provides the Owner’s Advisor with a vital mechanism to build
trust, translate concerns into solutions, and align development
goals with local realities.
As we continue with the Wellspring Manual, we will build
upon this foundation—exploring facility programming and
therapeutic design, and behavioral health construction man-

• State Licensing Authorities • Soft seating, warm lighting, natural textures
• The Joint Commission • Nature views and access to outdoor areas
• CMS, Medi-Cal, or Medicaid • Anti-ligature fixtures, tamper-resistant materials
• NFPA Life Safety Code • Multipurpose spaces to accommodate evolving care needs

When vision is translated into programming with clarity and

invite communities to see mental health treatment not as a last
resort, but as a natural and compassionate part of wellness.

Design Best Practices for Behavioral
Health Care
“If you think good design is expensive, you
should look at the cost of bad design.” -
Dr. Ralf Speth.
What you will learn in this chapter:
• Best Practices for Behavioral Health Care Facility Design
• Big 5 Best Practices
• Top 100 Best Practices
• Design Documentation Best Practices for Complex Systems
• Coordination Between Disciplines for Constructability
• Infection Control, Security, Ligature Resistance, and Accessibility
• Design for Healing, Treatment, and Recovery
• Managing Evolving User Needs Without Compromising Schedule
• Owner Review Cycles and Document Control Protocols
Chapter Overview
Design Development is where vision meets precision. It is the
technical phase where conceptual layouts evolve into construc-
tion-ready documents. In behavioral health real estate, this step
is mission-critical. Behavioral health facilities involve sensitive
populations, highly regulated care environments, and layered
interdisciplinary needs. As such, design must be purposeful,
clinically aligned, code-compliant, cost-aware, and fully coor-
dinated.

• 25 Top Key Professionals
• Power of Teamwork
Why So Many Subject Matter Experts?
Developing a behavioral health facility is one of the most
complex real estate endeavors, requiring precise coordination,
strict regulatory compliance, and a deep understanding of pa-
tient-centered care. Unlike traditional commercial or residential
projects, behavioral health facilities must seamlessly integrate
healthcare regulations, safety considerations, therapeutic design
principles, and operational efficiency.
This level of complexity demands a highly specialized team—
each professional playing a critical role in reducing risk,
maintaining compliance, and ensuring long-term opera-
tional success. Every subject matter expert (SME) contributes
essential knowledge and skills that prevent costly mistakes,
delays, or suboptimal facility performance.

clarity and consistency.” — Anonymous
What you will learn in this chapter:
• Keeping the Owner Informed: Reports, Tours, Decisions
• Field Changes, Change Orders, and Scope Creep Prevention
• Punch Lists, Inspections, and Regulatory Walkthroughs
• Ensuring a Culture of Care During Construction
• Managing Expectations for Substantial Completion
Chapter Overview
Construction administration (CA) represents the critical bridge
between field execution and operational activation. It is more
than a countdown to completion—it is the time when docu-
mentation, inspections, punchlists, and coordination culminate
in the final product. For behavioral health facilities, where
regulatory scrutiny, clinical precision, and trauma-informed
design intersect, this phase must be executed with discipline
and integrity.

Call to Action for Behavioral Health
Infrastructure
“The ultimate measure of a society is found in
how it treats its most vulnerable.”
— Mahatma Gandhi
A Moment of Opportunity
We are in a time of great change for behavioral health. Aware-
ness about mental health is rising, but many communities still
don’t have the facilities to meet the need. That gap is grow-
ing—and so is the urgency to act.
Every year, millions of people across the country struggle with
mental illness and substance use. Families are impacted. Hospi-
tals are overcrowded. People are waiting too long to get help.
It doesn’t have to be this way.
Behavioral health facilities aren’t just buildings. They are plac-
es of hope and healing. They shape how care is delivered, how
people feel, and how recovery begins.
