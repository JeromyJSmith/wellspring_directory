# Em Dash Replacement Rules

## Context
From the editing meeting: "We are going to go through the entire document, and we are going to replace the em dash for the appropriate more human readable punctuation and that will be defined by the context of the sentence or phrase and paragraph."

## Process
1. **Analysis Phase**: Scan entire document for em dash usage patterns
2. **Database Creation**: Create changelog of each em dash usage case
3. **Dry Run**: Test replacements before full implementation  
4. **Full Implementation**: Apply verified replacements
